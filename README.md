One of the key challenges in artificial intelligence
(AI) is how to insert the informal knowledge into a computer.
Several AI projects have sought to hard-code knowledge about
the world in formal languages. Nevertheless, a major source
of difficulty in many real-world AI applications is that many
variation factors influence every single piece of data we are able
to observe. Most applications require us to disentangle the factors
of variation and discard the ones that we do not care about.
Of course, it can be very difficult to extract such high-level,
abstract features from raw data. When it is nearly as difficult
to obtain a representation as to solve the original problem,
representation learning does not, at first glance, seem to help us.
Deep learning (DL) solves this central problem in representation
learning by introducing representations that are expressed in
terms of other, simpler representations. Nowadays DL is gaining
much popularity and wide use in various computer science fields,
such as object recognition, speech recognition, computer vision
and so forth. Nevertheless, the application of DL in network
systems has just started to receive research attention. In this
study, we are concerned with the investigation of the various deep
